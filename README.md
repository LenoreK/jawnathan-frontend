#Project Jawnathan-Frontend

Reflection:
Jawnathan-Frontend is a website where you can view Jawnathan's latest performances / music.

I built the "Jawnathan" website so that my brother would have a place to display his music. My hope was to create a website that he could use as an advertisement for his brand. When I was planning the website, there were certain things that I knew it would need. It needed a place to display his music and videos. It needed an enticing home page. It needed an about and contact page. And last of all, it needed a shop were he could sell merch in the future.

When building this website, I choose to keep the design simple. I find that simple designs tends to look better in the long run. I also choose to make a backend and database so that the website could easily grow in the future. This design is fairly easy to use, and I think anyone could figure out how to naviage the page.

However, the login / registration page is not obvious. The reason why I did this is because I don't really want it to be obvious. There is not much of a reason for people to login. I would need to create a better reason through something like a shop. But not that the functionality exists, it will be much easier to edit the website in the future.

My project stands out through the css. I think the front-end is what I excell at.  I understand how to make a pretty website, but I need to learn to make those websites more functional. This project was a great learning experience for me because it taught me to be more confident in the backend. I am sure that in my next project everything will move along much fast because I have the experience.

User-Story:
The user must be able to login and logout of the website. At the least, the admin needs to be able to login and logout.

flexgoal - there is a counter that keeps track of the amount of people attending each performance.

The user must be able to view the most recent performances.

The user must be able to visit social media sites and view the youtube videos on the site.

Flexgoal - the user can shop for t-shirts and mugs on the shop.

I need to eventually connect this website to spotify.
